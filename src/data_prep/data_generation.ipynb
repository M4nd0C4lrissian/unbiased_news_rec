The video, which has spread rapidly on social media, comes in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer and the subsequent demonstrations that have spread across the US and triggered a national debate over racism and police brutality.          \\u201cAs the commander of Pacific air forces, a senior leader in our air force, and an African American, many of you may be wondering what I\\u2019m thinking about the current events surrounding the tragic death of George Floyd,\\u201d Brown said in a nearly five-minute video posted to Twitter on Thursday.          \\u201cHere\\u2019s what I\\u2019m thinking about: I\\u2019m thinking about how full I am with emotion \\u2013 not just for George Floyd, but the many African Americans that have suffered the same fate as George Floyd.\\u201d          Brown continued: \\u201cThe equality expressed in our declaration of independence and the constitution that I\\u2019ve sworn my adult life to support and defend. I\\u2019m thinking about a history of racial issues and my own experiences that didn\\u2019t always sing of liberty and equality.\\u201d          Brown spoke bluntly about his own experiences of racism in the military.          \\u201cI\\u2019m thinking about my air force career, where I was often the only African American in my squadron or as a senior officer, the only African American in the room,\\u201d Brown said.          \\u201cI\\u2019m thinking about wearing the same flight suit, with the same wings on my chest as my peers, and then being questioned by another military member: \\u2018Are you a pilot?\\u2019          \\u201cI\\u2019m thinking about the pressure I felt to perform error-free, especially for supervisors I perceived had expected less from me as an African American. I\\u2019m thinking about having to represent by working twice as hard to prove their expectations and perceptions of African Americans were invalid.\\u201d          Brown\\u2019s moving video comes in the wake of statements from other air force leaders on racial inequality.          In a series of tweets on Monday, chief master sergeant of the air force Kaleth Wright, who is African American, decried the numerous deaths of black Americans at the hands of police.          \\u201cWho am I? I am a Black man who happens to be the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. I am George Floyd\\u2026I am Philando Castile, I am Michael Brown, I am Alton Sterling, I am Tamir Rice,\\u201d Wright tweeted.          It also comes as top military figures appear to be increasingly opposed to Donald Trump and his aggressive advocacy of a crackdown on protests, including by troops.          A series of current and former top military figures, including his ex-chief of staff John Kelly, former defense secretary James Mattis and current chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley have spoken out against Trump or taken stances opposed to him.\",\n          \"(WASHINGTON) \\u2014 Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan left an immigration policy conference Monday without speaking after protesters shouted him down.          McAleenan was scheduled as the keynote speaker at Georgetown University Law Center during an annual immigration law and policy conference held by the nonprofit immigration think tank Migration Policy Institute. He was expected to take questions from the audience, made up mostly of immigration policy experts, lawyers and advocates.          As he took the stage, a handful of protesters made up of law school students and activists stood up and held large black banners, one read \\u201cHate is Not Normal,\\u201d and shouted out that children were under attack. They also began yelling the names of children who had died after they were in immigration custody.          Homeland Security is the department that manages immigration enforcement and is largely responsible for meting out many of the massive changes pushed by the Trump administration that has restricting asylum, forced more than 50,000 migrants to wait in Mexico and added hurdles for those seeking green cards. Since December, at least seven children have died after they were taken into immigration custody, and officials have been grappling with a massive influx of migrants that vastly strained the system.          McAleenan, a longtime civil servant who was the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection before he was tapped to lead DHS, started off saying that he was a longtime law enforcement officer and believed in free speech, but said that public engagement was important.          Some in the audience shouted at the protesters to sit down so they could hear him speak. Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute who was the head of the agency that preceded Customs and Border protection, was to moderate the Q&A, and told the protesters they were robbing the audience of their ability to engage in a meaningful dialogue on a contentious and important topic.          McAleenan tried to speak at least three times, but eventually left, shaking hands with Meissner and others on stage. Some in the audience cheered when he left.          As Meissner moved on to the next panel, she questioned whether the protesters planned to stay for the whole conference and asked them to take their seats. They obeyed, but many left shortly after.          Migration Policy Institute President Andrew Selee said he regretted the speech was disrupted.          \\u201cIn a democracy, it is important to hear from all sides on public policy issues, including from those who are instrumental in developing and implementing policy, whether or not we agree with them,\\u201d he said, in a statement.          In a separate statement, DHS said that, \\u201cUnfortunately the Acting Secretary and the audience did not get the opportunity to engage in a robust dialogue this morning due to the disruptions of a few activists\\u2026. Event attendees would have learned more about DHS\\u2019s successful strategy to work with international partners to reduce unlawful migration and end the exploitation of children by smugglers and cartels, and then they would have had the opportunity to participate in an unmoderated question and answer session.\\u201d          \\u201cFor the benefit of all the attendees and members of the press,\\u201d the Department then shared the text of McAleenan\\u2019s planned speech.\",\n          \"President Trump's trade war with China has hit farmers especially hard. Beijing has sharply reduced Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products or cut them off completely. The loss of sales has led to talk that Trump may have put parts of rural America into play during the 2020 election.          Sen. Mike Braun, a freshman Indiana Republican, sees it differently. Yes, the farming industry is in a rough patch and is taking a lot of the heat in the trade war. But, in Braun's estimation, the people who think that farmers are breaking away from Trump because of that are flat wrong.          \\\"Farming has much deeper problems. Trade and tariffs are just the salt in the wound,\\\" Braun said in an interview with the medianame.          The costs farmers confront, such as seed, are at record highs at the same time their products are selling at historically low prices. International trade is the major part of the problem, Braun said, but that is mainly due to the simple issue of supply and demand. \\\"We've never competed with foreign producers like we are currently. In South America. In Asia. In Africa. Everywhere.\\\"          Braun, 65, represents a heavily agricultural state, serves on the Senate Agricultural Committee and was himself part of the farming industry. In 1979, he co-founded Crystal Farms, a Midwest turkey supplier that he sold in 2012. \\\"I know more about farming than any U.S. senator because I am involved in it,\\\" Braun said.          Beijing's Commerce Ministry announced in August that it had stopped buying U.S. agricultural goods in retaliation for the Trump administration decision to place new tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. Beijing has since backed away from that threat, but purchases of products like soybeans remain far below last year's levels.          At a surface level, the trade war would appear to account for the woes farmers are currently facing \\u2014 farm bankruptcies are up 13% in the past year, the American Farm Bureau Federation reported in late July. The farm group, however, like Braun, said the trade war was just one facet of the problem, with low prices, mounting debt, and natural disasters at least as much of a concern.          Indeed, polls have consistently found strong support for Trump among farmers. A July survey by the trade publication Farm Journal gave Trump a whopping 79% approval rating.          Directing substantial amounts of aid to farmers hasn't hurt. The administration announced in May that it would make $16 billion in payments to farmers to compensate for Chinese trade retaliation. That followed on top of $12 billion in assistance last year, also to make up for disruptions caused by trade fights with China and others. Farmers receive payments after applying for relief through the Department of Agriculture's Market Facilitation Program.          Braun pointed to another reason why the trade war hasn't soured farmers on Trump: China only buys a few products.          \\\"It's not affecting wheat. It's not affecting corn. It's been affecting soybeans, but that is offset by the market facilitation payments,\\\" Braun said, noting that the losses to soybeans are $1 to $2 of the per acre rate for the crops.          He conceded, though, that the payments are not an ideal solution. He'd prefer that the government not get involved because that creates its unknown complications. \\\"But it begs the question of what else we would have done to take China on. The Chinese are smart, so they aim politically at Trump's strongest group of supporters who are in the weakest shape,\\\" he said. \\\"That's more of an insight into how tough of a competitor they will become down the road.\\\"          Braun stressed that he doesn't want to minimize the impact of the trade war for those who are suffering. In any event, there's no real benefit to farmers in a trade war either way. Ask any farmer, and they'd rather sell their products than taking help from the USDA, he said. The ones who stand to gain from an improved trade deal with China are manufacturers and the high-tech industry.          The senator said that concerns of China \\\"decoupling\\\" from trade with the U.S. and its buying farm goods from other countries are overblown. \\\"In the long run, if the Chinese pull it all away and buy from elsewhere, where do you think the people are going to go that used to buy from the countries that China is now buying from?\\\" he asked. \\\"It's a world market, and it will all get evened out.\\\"          Braun argued that while the problem may be overproduction and there's going to have to be a period of adjustment for farmers, it doesn't mean they have to fold up. It merely means diversifying and looking into new products. The family farm has gone from 160 acres three or four decades ago to something in the neighborhood of 2,500 acres today, he said. \\\"Maybe you start reforesting acres that are cleared.\\\"          The Hoosier Republican can even start to sound a bit like a '60s hippie when he discusses how producers could adapt, arguing that they should look into organic farming. \\\"I was glad hemp came along because it is maybe another a product you can do in scale,\\\" he said. \\\"Kentucky and Indiana just passed state legislation. I think that is a real possibility in the long run. You're going to have to do other things with your acres that aren't in a glut.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_partisan_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.4142356475481295,\n        \"min\": -2.0,\n        \"max\": 2.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -1.0,\n          2.0,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_set = train_set.sample(frac=1)\n","train_set = train_set.sample(frac=1)\n","train_set = train_set.sample(frac=1)\n","train_set = train_set.sample(frac=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"uHOiqZ8LUGpj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555415944,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_set = test_set.sample(frac=1)\n","test_set = test_set.sample(frac=1)\n","test_set = test_set.sample(frac=1)\n","test_set = test_set.sample(frac=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"a2mnOxGIUPsA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555415945,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["val_set = val_set.sample(frac=1)\n","val_set = val_set.sample(frac=1)\n","val_set = val_set.sample(frac=1)\n","val_set = val_set.sample(frac=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"A-LVddX-UUqL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555415945,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_set.to_csv('bert_training_set.csv')\n","test_set.to_csv('bert_testing_set.csv')\n","val_set.to_csv('bert_validation_set.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"sFLsfg2WCLGZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423775,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7835,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["######### Dataset to generate bert embeddings over"],"metadata":{"id":"kpgwg-TeERnY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423776,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# bert_filter = make_filter(temp, ['article_id', 'title', 'text'])"],"metadata":{"id":"ZFaRtQo9Wsas","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423776,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# bert_filter.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"8a17dqR9WymM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423776,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":47,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# bert_filter.describe()"],"metadata":{"id":"DFfQxWbwX1P7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423776,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# bert_filter.to_csv('bert_filter.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"qvh3RUS8Z10d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423776,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"HAs8rUEQZ-JT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732555423776,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Eamon Earl","userId":"15976131242225192943"}}},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[]}]}
