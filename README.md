# My Work! 

None of the data is here (far too much)

The original dataset can be found here:

[Data is here.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/31bvt18zjkql2zorltx6k/AHRjtozu_8w_xuixWmRkv88?rlkey=w5bg63wi551trq6trwsjqrxwc&st=fhbbaf5m&dl=0)

All of the code is mine, asides from stuff sourced from: 

```bibtex
@inproceedings{liu2021interaction,
  title={The interaction between political typology and filter bubbles in news recommendation algorithms},
  author={Liu, Ping and Shivaram, Karthik and Culotta, Aron and Shapiro, Matthew A and Bilgic, Mustafa},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021},
  pages={3791--3801},
  year={2021}
}
```

Those files are called: 

- collaborative_filtering.py
- oracle.py
- rand_content.py
- sim_functions.py
- user_choice.py
- user_generation.py

They're mostly for generating the 1000 test user mdoels and exemplar user models. The only data you'll see included here is the data used for that. I only used functions from the last two for simulating user choice, and just copy pasted them in the files needed. The rest of the code I completed myself.
